### About
This is a platformer game made almost from scratch with the goal of learning game programming and 
improving programming skills in general. Various things like collision detection, sprite animation, menus, buttons, etc.
were all coded from scratch. For collision detection a very basic method called AABB collision detection method is used. 
The level maps were created with the help of [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/).
[PyTMX](https://github.com/bitcraft/PyTMX) is used to read and load the level maps
